=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::RefEng -
Reference Implementation of Muldis D Over Perl 5

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Muldis::D::RefEng version 0.0.0 for Perl 5.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Muldis::D::RefEng is the reference implementation of the Muldis D language,
authority B<http://muldis.com>, version number B<0.200>.  While other
Muldis D implementations also may exist, this one over Perl 5 is the
canonical one.

TODO: Rewrite this paragraph.
The separate all-documentation distribution L<Muldis::D> also exists; it
was intended to be the formal definition of the Muldis D language, but it
is currently years out of date; until it catches up, Muldis::D::RefEng also
serves double-duty as the formal language definition.

The Muldis D language itself has as a primary influence the work of Chris
Date (C.J. Date) and Hugh Darwen whose home website is
L<http://www.thethirdmanifesto.com/>.
